`	`When a word is typed, a popup menu appears. This popup menu lists the suggested words for the dynamically typed sub-word. The popup menu allows you to choose the required word either using a mouse (double-click) or a keyboard (up and down arrow keys and enter key).

When any operation within the text editor is abruptly closed, a popup dialog box appears informing that the operation has been terminated.
